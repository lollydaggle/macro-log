It's Day 1! I'm working with [Stronger U](https://strongeru.com/) for at least 12 weeks. These next 12 weeks I expect to be ones that I will stay primarily inside for, even as things in the U.S. begin to open up. At the start of quarantine, I did the obnoxious thing where I thought about my goals for this time. Given a work from home environment and no social/ travel committments, what could I accomplish? Yet, a global pandemic fueling anxiety, grief and loss obviously added stress. 

One thing I wanted to do was lose the weight I put on during IVF. I didn't put on a ton of weight - about 10 pounds but it was frigtening to see that number of the scale for me and feel so out of sorts with my body. In the first 12 weeks of quarantine, I actually did take a lot of that weight off. But, it was hapharzard, stressful and didn't feel like I was committed to this goal. What I did spend a lot of this time doing was working out. Killing it on Peloton rides and adding more strength, yoga and running to my routine. But, if I'm working out this much, I want to look like I'm working out this much. 

Enter Stronger U. What I'm hoping to acheive the next 12 weeks is weight loss that isn't so stressful or fraught or haphazard. I know I need structure, something on the line (a lot of $$ in this case) and outside accountability. This works for me. While I'm not excited about macro tracking or weighing everything I put into my body, I am data driven. I'm hoping this data helps me meet my goals. 

I wanted to start this space, not because I want other people to read it, but to build accountability to myself and watch how my journey changes over time. I'm not sure what each of these daily logs will look like still but I am committed to completing them. For now, I want to share pictures of what I'm eating, with their macro counts to build a visual diary. I also want to share what I'm working on from a fitness perspective.
